## Defining Security Vulnerability

We as contributors and security professionals follow the [MITRE.org](https://www.mitre.org) definition of a security vulnerability:

> Security vulnerability is a weakness in the computational logic found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Mitigation of the vulnerabilities in this context typically involves coding changes but could also include specification changes or even specification deprecations.

## Reporting Security Issues

Please don't report security vulnerabilities through issue tracking or the public internet.

Instead, report them by email [security@laroccx.io](mailto:security@laroccx.io?subject=Security%20Vulnerability%20Report).

You should receive a reply response promptly. If for some reason you don't, follow-up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (buffer overflow, sql injection, cross-site scripting, default configuration, etc)
- Full paths of source files related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code and/or files (tag, branch, commit or direct url)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly!
